In lower income countries, corruption is present and takes a toll, preventing these countries to economically develop. It is present at all levels and it impacts more if the elected officials are corrupt. To have better conditions to develop, it is key for those countries to have a fair and transparent election process, as well as provide secure, more accessible, cost-effective ways to have more citizens to exercise the right to vote.

# Solution:
According to OECD ( * ) corruption is widespread and part of the culture in most developing countries and the cost of implementing reforms is high. Our solution starts to tackle the issue from top to bottom, focusing into the government election process, and an alternative to providing a scalable, extensible way—technically and functionally to provide transparency at a lower cost. It leverages Chaincode to develop smart contracts over Hyperledger Fabric. It can provide an alternative (in technology and more efficient processes) to over a hundred developing nations (with over 5 billion inhabitants) that attended the International Anti-Corruption Conference and have intentions to fight this issue.
